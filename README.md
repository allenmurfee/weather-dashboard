# Weather Dashboard with Forecast

## Description

This project is a weather dashboard application that shows the current conditions and the 5-day forecast. It also saves your searches in recent history so you can easily click on different searches to see the weather. This application was built to easily give the user access to city weather information.

This was the first assignment we had where we had to use a 3rd-party API, and it taught me a ton about accessing information and data, and how to display it effectively on a web page. It was difficult for me to create elements based on specific data within the API, but it helped me learn a lot throughout the process. Also, setting and accessing data from local storage was a challenge with API data, but again, it was a great learning experience.

## Installation

No installation required. Visit https://allenmurfee.github.io/weather-dashboard/ to start getting weather information.

## Usage

To use this application, visit https://allenmurfee.github.io/weather-dashboard/. Search a city's weather information by typing the city name in the "Search" box and click the "Search" button - then the data will populate. Once you search something by clicking on the "Search" button, it will add it to your recent history. You can click on any text in your recent history to pull up that city's data again.
